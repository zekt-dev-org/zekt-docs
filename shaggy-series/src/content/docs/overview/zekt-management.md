Once you are a valued Zekt member - your account will be able to open the Zekt management console, a web based UI - which will act as your one-stop shop for managing your Zekt interactions. Even though the "whole website" is built for responssive html / styling - we strongly recommend working with the Zekt management UI - on a device with considerable screen estate (as we want to jam as much functionality into a single UI) and not smaller mobile devices (for the same reason).

The Zekt management console - is supporting and offers different sets of functionality, depending on the [personas](../zekt-personas) you chose to be during initial onboarding (e.g - a provider persona will be able to configure things associated with that persona - like service descriptions and so forth, will a consumer will be able to interact in their own way - while customers that choose "both" - can access all aspects of the management UI). 

## Management console - Provider

The Zekt management console - allows a provider to quickly onboard their "repositories" to Zekt. Once the repository or repositories have been onboarded, the provider would create a "service description" and associate it to the repistory (1-to-1 relationship between a single repository and service description). Finally - they would have to make an activce decision if they would like to publish their "service description" in the Zekt directory - thereby making it become "discoverable" to other consumers that are using Zekt.
