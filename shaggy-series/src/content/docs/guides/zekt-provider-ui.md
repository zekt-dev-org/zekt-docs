This guide will showcase the "provider repos" part of the Zekt management console UI as seen below. 
![Zekt Provider Repositories](../../../assets/zekt-provider-repo.png)

In order to be able to choose the "Provider" item on the left hand side of the management console (A) - you need to either be a "Provider" or "Both" (meaning Provider & Consumer) - which is an aossicated property of your profile. This property steers access to the navigation tab, as it only contain functionality relevant if you are a "provider" or "provider and consumer". [Please re-visist Zekt documentation, read Zekt personas in order to make an informed decisions if there are concerns](../overview/zekt-personas).

The first option (functionality) shown, is the "Zekt Repos" tab. This tab (B) - is where you onboard an existing Github repository that you have access to, into the Zekt. Columns Status & Actions - show you clearly if a repository is Enabled or Disabled - from a Zekt perspective (we will never alter Github repository status from Zekt) - in the picture defined as (C).

As soon as you have perform a repository onboarding - the SKU counter will updated (D) - to show you how many repoistories can be onboarded prior to either "de-zektify" an existing repository, or to aquire a higher SKU, enabling you to enable Zekt for additional repoistories.
