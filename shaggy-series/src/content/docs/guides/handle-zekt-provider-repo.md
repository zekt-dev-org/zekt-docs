## - Zekt Repos (Provider)

The management console (UI) - is having persona based navigation items. Top one, being the "Provider" item. As soon as you click on it, you will be taken to the "Zekt Repos" tab (for the provider persona). In this view - you will be able to enable / disable repositories for which you are in control of. The enablement is about instrumenting the repositories with the required Zekt Orchestration App (approving it) and placing the required Zekt webhook in the target repository. Likewise, you can disable a Zekt repository from this UI - when the repository is no longer needed.
